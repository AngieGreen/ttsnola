# # the 'for' loop isn't used as often, but is great for numbers

# x = 0
# while x <= 10
#   puts "#{x} is the loneliest number everrrrrrr!"
#   x += 1
# end
# puts "We have exited the loop!"
# # the 'while' loop runs when the loop is true

# 5.times do |i|
#   puts "We are at number #{i}!?!?!?!?"
# end
# # every 'do' block needs a |THING| and an end

# for n in 1..5
#   puts "We are at number #{n}."
# end
# # THIS IS THE SAME AS:
# 1.upto(5) { |n| puts "We are at number #{n}."}
